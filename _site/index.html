    <p>Politicians, advisors and the media have a tremendous influence on policies that affect technology and technology-related industries. But technology is a vast, rapidly changing and surprisingly unintuitive field. It is changing the way we communicate, conduct business, learn, heal the sick, and generally progress as a civilisation. Which decision makers and influencers actually have a basic grasp of this increasingly important and pervasive field?</p>

Either she was being mischievous, or she didn't know what she was talking about - it's either one or the other. [...] That's normal. The average age of MPs is in their forties and most of them think they're being very clever if they go on Twitter. They don't understand much about the [technology] mechanisms they are dealing with&quot;</p>

          <p class="quote">&quot;Consider the case of a teenage girl going missing. At present we can ask her mobile provider for call records before she went missing which could be invaluable to finding her. But for Internet access, all we get is that the Internet was accessed 300 times. What would be useful would be to know she accessed twitter just before she went missing in the same way as we could see she make a phone call&quot;</p>
